Description: Functions to facilitate simulation studies for time to event 
    endpoints with non-proportional hazards. The package includes functions to 
    simulate time to event data in different scenarios with non-proportional 
    hazards, functions to simulate different trial-designs including 
    fixed-followup and event driven designs as well as group sequential designs.
    Functions to calculate the true values of common summary statistics for the
    implemented scenarios are included as well as common analysis methods for
    time to event data. Additionally the package contains some helper functions
    to facilitate running simulations with the 'SimDesign' package and
    aggregating and presenting the results. Results of the conducted simulation
    study are published in the following preprint
    <doi:10.48550/ARXIV.2310.05622>.
