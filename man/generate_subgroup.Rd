\description{
Generate Dataset with different treatment effect in subgroup

Create an empty assumtions data.frame for generate_subgroup

Calculate true summary statistics for scenarios with differential treatment effect in subgroup

Calculate hazards in treatment arm in subgroup and compliment
}
\details{
Condidtion has to contain the following columns:
\itemize{
\item n_trt number of paitents in treatment arm
\item n_ctrl number of patients in control arm
\item hazard_ctrl hazard in the control arm
\item hazard_trt hazard in the treatment arm for not cured patients
\item hazard_subgroup hazard in the subgroup in the treatment arm
\item prevalence proportion of cured patients
}

assumptions_subgroup prints the code to generate a default
design tibble for use with generate_subgroup and returns the
evaluated code invisibly. This function is intended to be used to copy
paste the code and edit the parameters.

\code{cutoff_stats} are the times used to calculate the statistics like average
hazard ratios and RMST, that are only calculated up to a certain point.

\code{hazard_subgroup_from_PH_effect_size} calculates the hazard rate in
the subgroup and the compliment of the subgroup in the treatment arm as
follows: First, the hazard ratio needed to archive the desired power under
proportional hazards is calculated by inverting Schönfeld's sample size
formula. Second the median survival times for both arms under this hazard
ratio and proportional hazards are calculated. Finally the hazard rate of
the treatment arm in the subgroup and its complement are set such that the
median survival time is the same as the one calculated under proportional
hazards.

This is a heuristic and to some extent arbitrary approach to calculate
hazard ratios that correspond to reasonable and realistic scenarios.

cen_rate_from_cen_prop_subgroup takes the proportion of
censored patients from the column \code{censoring_prop}. This column describes
the proportion of patients who are censored randomly before experiencing an
event, without regard to administrative censoring.
